<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>MetroloJ is a commonly used plugin for analysing quality control data. However, the plugin saves the analysed data and results locally.
Due to the need for a FAIR data management, there is an increasing need to upload also the QC results to Omero.</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Short description of macro</h2>
This macro is used for uploading on an omero server the MetroloJ QC results of the PSF analysis. 
The macro accepts as input the folder which contains:

<ul>the analysed raw image files (currently .tif/.tiff, .czi and .nd2)</ul>
<ul>the results folder of MetroloJ named "Processed"</ul>
<p>The macro generates a new Project on Omero (name given by the user), and a new Dataset (defined by the MetroloJ; name of the folder under the "Processed" folder).
For each of the raw files, the macro finds the coordinates of the beads that were analysed and generates a ROI at the raw data which is uploaded to Omero.
For each of the analysed beads the macro finds the FWHM measured value (for X, Y and Z) as well as the R2 of the fitted curve and prints them in a Results table. 
Subsequently, the Results is uploaded as an Omero table and as a .csv file,  together with the summary.pdf and the summary.xls (which are generated by MetroloJ). All these files appear as attachements on the Dataset level.</p>

<h2>User Interface - Running the macro</h2>
<p>Running the macro will start with the user input interface as seen at the figure below.
The interface has two parts. The first part is used for the login information necessary to connect to an omero server.</p>
