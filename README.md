<h1>Description of macro</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
MetroloJ is a commonly used plugin for analysing quality control data. However, the plugin saves the analysed data and results locally.
Due to the need for a FAIR data management, there is an increasing need to upload also the QC results to Omero.
<h2>Description of macro</h2>
This macro is used for uploading on an omero server the MetroloJ QC results of the PSF analysis. 
The macro accepts as input the folder which contains:<br><br>

<ul>the analysed raw image files (.tif or .tiff)</ul>
<ul>the results folder of MetroloJ named "Processed"</ul>
<p>The macro generates a new Project on Omero (name given by the user), and a new Dataset (defined by the MetroloJ; name of the folder under the "Processed" folder).
For each of the raw files, the macro finds the coordinates of the beads that were analysed and generates a ROI at the raw data which is uploaded to Omero.
For each of the analysed beads the macro finds the FWHM measured value (for X, Y and Z) as well as the R2 of the fitted curve and prints them in a Results table. 
Subsequently, the Results is uploaded as an Omero table together with the summary.pdf (generated by MetroloJ) are uploaded on the Dataset level.</p>
